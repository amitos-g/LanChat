<h1>This is a group chat app for a lan network!</h1>
This is a project I have made with java, basically to practice socket programming and get familliar with it. <br>
This project contains a Server file, which is meant to run only 1 time (per server/host), and will be controlled from the terminal. <br>
This project contains a client folder too, with ui (java swing), which is basically the interface for the "app".
<h1>How will it work?</h1>
Simple, the client's will connect to the server, send data to it, and the server will broadcast the data by the client's name to the whole chat, mimcking a group chat's behaviour.
